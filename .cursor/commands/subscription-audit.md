# /subscription-audit

Audit trial and payment logic compliance for Bloomwell AI's subscription system.

## Purpose

Ensure all subscription-related code follows our business model requirements and maintains tamper-proof trial logic for nonprofit organizations.

## Critical Subscription Logic

### 1. Pricing Structure Compliance

- **Monthly**: $29.99/month (exact amount, no rounding)
- **Annual**: $209/year (equivalent to $17.42/month, 42% discount)
- **Free trial**: 14 days, no credit card required
- **Conversion tracking**: Trial-to-paid metrics required
- **Proration**: Handle mid-cycle changes correctly

### 2. Trial Period Security

- **Tamper-proof logic**: Server-side validation only
- **14-day calculation**: From account creation, not first login
- **No credit card**: Trial users cannot be charged
- **Grace period**: Clear communication before trial expires
- **Conversion prompts**: Strategic, non-aggressive messaging

### 3. Subscription Status Validation

- **Premium features**: Check subscription status before access
- **API endpoints**: Validate trial/subscription on every request
- **Database queries**: Include subscription status in user queries
- **UI components**: Show appropriate upgrade prompts
- **Error handling**: Graceful degradation for expired trials

## 📚 **ADMIN USERS PAGE FEATURES**

Now working correctly:

### User List Display

- View all registered users
- Paginated results (20 per page)
- User details: name, email, organization
- Account type indicator (Google, Microsoft, Email)
- Activity metrics (conversations, RSVPs)
- Last login timestamp

### Search & Filter

- Search by name, email, or organization name
- Filter by account type (OAuth vs email)
- Filter by activity (active, inactive, never logged in)
- Real-time search updates

### Sorting Options

- Sort by creation date
- Sort by name
- Sort by email
- Sort by organization
- Sort by last login
- Ascending/descending order

### User Management

- View user details
- Track user engagement
- Monitor organization associations
- Identify active/inactive users

## 🔐 **AUTHENTICATION**

### Admin Login Required

- **URL:** http://localhost:3000/admin/login
- **Username:** admin
- **Password:** admin123 (change in production!)
- **Auth Method:** JWT token with NEXTAUTH_SECRET

### Token Usage

The admin page stores JWT in localStorage as `adminSession` and includes it in all API requests:

```typescript
Authorization: Bearer <jwt-token>
```

## 🎓 **KEY LEARNINGS**

### Prisma Best Practices

1. **Always match model names exactly** in relations
2. **Use Prisma Studio** to visualize schema
3. **Reference schema** before writing queries
4. **Don't disconnect** in API routes (use connection pooling)
5. **Test with actual data** after schema changes

### Common Patterns

```typescript
// ✅ CORRECT
const users = await prisma.user.findMany({
  include: {
    Organization: true, // Capital O - matches model
    Account: true, // Capital A - matches model
    Conversation: true, // Capital C - matches model
    WebinarRSVP: true, // Exact model name
  },
});

// ❌ INCORRECT
const users = await prisma.user.findMany({
  include: {
    organization: true, // lowercase - doesn't exist
    accounts: true, // plural - doesn't match
    conversations: true, // plural - doesn't match
    rsvps: true, // abbreviated - doesn't match
  },
});
```

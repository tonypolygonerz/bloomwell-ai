   - Change to: `Bloomwell AI`
   - Click "Save and Continue"

4. **Wait for Propagation**
   - Changes take 5-10 minutes to appear
   - Clear browser cache if needed

## ‚úÖ **YOUR CODE IS ALREADY CORRECT**

No code changes needed! Your OAuth implementation is properly configured:

```typescript
// src/app/api/auth/[...nextauth]/route.ts
GoogleProvider({
  clientId: process.env.GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID!,
  clientSecret: process.env.GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET!,
});
```

The app name displayed to users is controlled by Google Cloud Console, not your code.

---

## üß™ **TESTING AFTER FIX**

Once you've updated Google Cloud Console:

### Test 1: New User Sign-up

```bash
# 1. Open incognito window
# 2. Visit: http://localhost:3000/auth/register
# 3. Click "Continue with Google"
# 4. Verify consent screen shows "Bloomwell AI"
```

### Test 2: Verify Database

```bash
cd ~/nonprofit-ai-assistant
sqlite3 prisma/dev.db "SELECT email, name FROM User WHERE email LIKE '%@gmail.com' LIMIT 5;"
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **IMPORTANT NOTES**

### If You Don't Have Access

If you don't have access to the Google Cloud Console:

1. Check who created the OAuth app
2. Request owner/editor access to the Google Cloud project
3. Or create a new OAuth app with correct credentials

### Current Status

- ‚úÖ Your code is correct
- ‚úÖ Server is running
- ‚è≥ Waiting for Google Cloud Console update
- üîÑ No code changes needed

### What Won't Work

These won't fix the issue:

- ‚ùå Changing environment variables
- ‚ùå Updating NextAuth configuration
- ‚ùå Modifying OAuth provider settings in code
- ‚ùå Restarting the server

Only updating Google Cloud Console will fix the branding.

## üöÄ **AFTER THE FIX**

Once the branding is updated and tested:

### Recommended Improvements (Optional)

1. Add logo to OAuth consent screen (120x120px PNG)
2. Add privacy policy URL
3. Add terms of service URL
4. Configure support email
5. Verify scopes are minimal (only email and profile)

### For Production Deployment

1. Update app status from "Testing" to "In Production"
2. Add production redirect URIs:
   - `https://bloomwell-ai.com/api/auth/callback/google`
3. Complete Google verification process if required
4. Update environment variables for production

## üìû **NEED HELP?**

### Can't Find OAuth Consent Screen?

# Trial End Date Fix - Complete ✅

**Date:** October 11, 2025  
**Issue:** Users had `trialStartDate` populated but `trialEndDate` was NULL in the database

## Problem Analysis

When users were created (via registration or OAuth), the code only set basic user fields and relied on database defaults:
- ✅ `trialStartDate` had `@default(now())` in schema - automatically set
- ❌ `trialEndDate` had no default - remained NULL
- ✅ `subscriptionStatus` defaulted to "TRIAL"

The system worked functionally because the `/api/user/trial-status` endpoint calculated trial end dates dynamically:
```typescript
const trialEnd = user.trialEndDate || new Date(trialStart.getTime() + 14 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000);
```

However, this caused:
1. **Database inconsistency** - NULL values in production data
2. **Query difficulties** - Can't easily find expiring trials
3. **Confusion** - Unclear state when viewing database directly

## Files Modified

### 1. `/src/app/api/auth/register/route.ts`
**Before:** Only set `name`, `email`, `password`  
**After:** Now explicitly sets:
- `trialStartDate` - current date
- `trialEndDate` - 14 days from start
- `subscriptionStatus` - "TRIAL"

### 2. `/src/app/api/auth/[...nextauth]/route.ts`
**Before:** OAuth users created without trial dates  
**After:** OAuth signups now set same trial fields as regular registration

### 3. `/scripts/fix-trial-dates.js` (New)
- Finds all users with NULL `trialEndDate` and status "TRIAL"
- Calculates proper trial end date (14 days from start)
- Updates database with correct values
- Provides detailed logging of changes

## Verification

Ran migration script on existing database:
```
Found 1 users without trial end dates
✅ Fixed trial dates for: tony@famlisoul.org
   Trial Start: 2025-10-11T05:10:23.038Z
   Trial End:   2025-10-25T05:10:23.038Z
   Days Remaining: 14
```

## Result

✅ **All new users** will have `trialEndDate` properly set at creation  
✅ **Existing user** now has correct trial end date in database  
✅ **Database consistency** - All trial fields properly populated  
✅ **Query support** - Can now efficiently query for expiring trials  

## Business Logic

- Free trial: **14 days** from registration
- Trial automatically calculated: `trialStartDate + 14 days`
- Consistent across both registration methods (email/password and OAuth)
- Database now reflects actual business rules

## Future Considerations

- Consider adding database migration to backfill any future NULL values
- Add monitoring for trial expirations
- Consider automated email notifications at 7 days, 3 days, and 1 day before trial ends
- Track trial-to-paid conversion rates

## Testing Checklist

- [x] Existing user trial date fixed in database
- [x] Code changes formatted with Prettier
- [x] No linting errors
- [ ] Test new registration with trial dates set
- [ ] Test OAuth registration with trial dates set
- [ ] Verify trial status API returns correct dates
- [ ] Check Prisma Studio shows populated trial dates

## How to Run Fix Script (if needed in future)

```bash
node scripts/fix-trial-dates.js
```

This will update any users with NULL trial end dates.

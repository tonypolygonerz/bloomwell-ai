# ProPublica Auto-Fill Fix - October 17, 2025

## 🐛 Issue Identified
The organization basics form was incorrectly auto-filling mission statements and focus areas from ProPublica data when users selected an organization from the search dropdown. This violated the progressive onboarding design, which requires users to write their own mission statements and select their own focus areas.

## 🔍 Root Cause
In `/src/app/profile/basics/page.tsx`, the `handleOrganizationSelect` function (line 85-94) was setting:
```typescript
mission: org.mission || prev.mission,  // ❌ This was the problem
```

This caused ProPublica mission data to be auto-filled, making the form appear as if users had already completed those fields.

## ✅ Solution Implemented

### 1. Database Check
- ✅ Verified no stale organization data exists in the database
- ✅ Confirmed database is clean (no "Fa Mli" or EIN "954420147" records)

### 2. Fixed `handleOrganizationSelect` Function
**File:** `/src/app/profile/basics/page.tsx` (lines 85-95)

**Before:**
```typescript
const handleOrganizationSelect = (org: ProPublicaOrganization) => {
  setSelectedOrganization(org);
  setFormData(prev => ({
    ...prev,
    name: org.name,
    mission: org.mission || prev.mission,  // ❌ Auto-filled mission
    state: org.state || prev.state,
    ein: org.ein,
  }));
};
```

**After:**
```typescript
const handleOrganizationSelect = (org: ProPublicaOrganization) => {
  setSelectedOrganization(org);
  setFormData(prev => ({
    ...prev,
    name: org.name,
    state: org.state || prev.state,
    ein: org.ein,
    organizationType: '501c3', // Auto-select 501(c)(3) from ProPublica
    // Do NOT auto-fill mission or focusAreas - user must write these
  }));
};
```

### 3. Fixed `handleClearSelection` Function
**File:** `/src/app/profile/basics/page.tsx` (lines 97-107)

**Updated to:**
```typescript
const handleClearSelection = () => {
  setSelectedOrganization(null);
  setFormData(prev => ({
    ...prev,
    name: '',
    ein: '',
    state: '',
    organizationType: '',
    // Keep mission and focusAreas as they are - user might have started typing
  }));
};
```

### 4. Verified Placeholders
✅ **Mission Statement** (line 256):
- Placeholder: `"What is your organization's mission? (minimum 20 characters)"`
- Shows clear gray placeholder text when empty
- Character counter shows "0/20 characters minimum"

✅ **Focus Areas** (line 321):
- Placeholder: `"e.g., Youth Development, Environmental Justice, Arts Education"`
- Shows helpful examples in gray placeholder text

## 🎯 Expected User Experience

### When Selecting from ProPublica Search:
1. User types: "Fa Mli"
2. Dropdown shows: "Fa Mli - Los Angeles, CA - EIN: 954420147"
3. User clicks selection

**AUTO-FILLS (✅):**
- ✅ Organization Name: "Fa Mli"
- ✅ EIN: "954420147"
- ✅ State: "CA"
- ✅ Organization Type: "501(c)(3) Nonprofit"

**REMAINS EMPTY (⚪):**
- ⚪ Mission Statement: [gray placeholder: "What is your organization's mission? (minimum 20 characters)"]
- ⚪ Focus Areas: [gray placeholder: "e.g., Youth Development, Environmental Justice, Arts Education"]

## 🧪 Testing Instructions

### Test Case 1: ProPublica Search
1. Navigate to `/profile/basics`
2. Search for "Fa Mli" in the organization search
3. Select the organization from the dropdown
4. **Verify:**
   - Name is filled: "Fa Mli"
   - EIN is filled: "954420147"
   - State is filled: "CA"
   - Organization Type is selected: "501(c)(3) Nonprofit"
   - Mission field is EMPTY with placeholder text
   - Focus Areas field is EMPTY with placeholder text

### Test Case 2: Clear Selection
1. After selecting an organization, click "Clear" (X button)
2. **Verify:**
   - Name is cleared
   - EIN is cleared
   - State is cleared
   - Organization Type is cleared
   - Mission and Focus Areas remain if user typed anything

### Test Case 3: Manual Entry
1. Don't use ProPublica search
2. Manually type organization name
3. Fill in all fields manually
4. **Verify:** All fields work as expected

## 📊 Impact

### User Experience
- ✅ Users now write their own mission statements (better for grant matching)
- ✅ Users select their own focus areas (more personalized)
- ✅ ProPublica data still helpful for basic organizational info
- ✅ Progressive onboarding flow works as designed

### Data Quality
- ✅ Mission statements are now user-generated and relevant
- ✅ Focus areas reflect actual organizational priorities
- ✅ No confusion from pre-filled data

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Files Modified
1. `/src/app/profile/basics/page.tsx` - Fixed auto-fill logic

### Files Reviewed (No Changes Needed)
1. `/src/app/api/onboarding/sections/basics/route.ts` - API route is correct
2. `/src/components/OrganizationSearch.tsx` - Component is correct
3. Database schema - No changes needed

### Linter Status
✅ No linter errors
✅ All TypeScript types correct
✅ Code passes validation

## 🎉 Status: COMPLETE

The ProPublica auto-fill issue has been fixed. Users can now select organizations from ProPublica to auto-fill basic info (name, EIN, state, type) while still being required to write their own mission statements and select their own focus areas.

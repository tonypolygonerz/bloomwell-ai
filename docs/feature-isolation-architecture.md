# Bloomwell AI Feature Isolation Architecture

This document provides an overview of the feature isolation architecture implemented for Bloomwell AI.

## Overview

The feature isolation architecture allows individual features to be enabled, disabled, and monitored independently. This ensures that if one feature fails, it doesn't affect the rest of the application. The architecture consists of several components:

1. **Error Boundaries**: React components that catch JavaScript errors and display fallback UI
2. **Feature Flags**: Configuration system for enabling/disabling features
3. **Monitoring**: System for tracking feature health and performance
4. **CI/CD Integration**: Pipeline for testing and deploying features independently
5. **Rollback Strategies**: Procedures for rolling back features if issues are detected

## Components

### Error Boundaries

The `ErrorBoundary` component catches JavaScript errors in its child component tree and displays a fallback UI. It also reports errors to the monitoring system.

```tsx
<ErrorBoundary featureName="grants" fallback={<FallbackUI />}>
  <GrantSearchFeature />
</ErrorBoundary>
```

### Feature Flags

The feature flag system allows features to be enabled or disabled via environment variables, runtime overrides, or CI/CD pipeline results.

```tsx
// Check if a feature is enabled
const isGrantsEnabled = isFeatureEnabled(FEATURE_FLAGS.GRANTS);

// Use the feature flag in a component
const { enabled } = useFeatureFlag(FEATURE_FLAGS.GRANTS);
```

### Feature Boundary

The `FeatureBoundary` component combines error boundaries with feature flags to provide a complete feature isolation solution.

```tsx
<FeatureBoundary featureName={FEATURE_FLAGS.GRANTS}>
  <GrantSearchFeature />
</FeatureBoundary>
```

### Monitoring

The monitoring system tracks feature health and performance metrics. It integrates with the error boundary system to report errors.

```tsx
// Initialize monitoring
initMonitoring({
  debug: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_MONITORING_DEBUG === 'true',
  sampleRate: 0.1,
});

// Track feature performance
useFeatureMonitoring(FEATURE_FLAGS.GRANTS);
```

### CI/CD Integration

The CI/CD pipeline tests features independently and automatically disables features that fail their tests.

```yaml
# Feature-specific tests
test-grants:
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  steps:
    - name: Run grants tests
      run: npm run test:grants
```

### Rollback Strategies

The rollback system allows features to be rolled back individually or as a group.

```bash
# Disable a feature
npm run deploy:disable-feature -- --feature=grants --env=production

# Roll back a specific feature
npm run deploy:rollback:feature -- --feature=grants --env=production

# Roll back the entire application
npm run deploy:rollback -- --env=production
```

### Feature List

The following features can be isolated:

1. **Grants**: Grant search and matching functionality
2. **Webinars**: Nonprofit webinar platform
3. **Chat**: AI chat assistant for nonprofits
4. **PDF Processing**: PDF document processing and analysis
5. **Subscription**: Subscription and payment processing

## Usage

### Adding a New Feature

1. Add a new feature flag to `featureFlags.ts`
2. Wrap the feature in a `FeatureBoundary` component
3. Add feature-specific tests
4. Update the CI/CD pipeline to test the feature independently

### Monitoring Feature Health

1. Check the monitoring dashboard for feature metrics
2. Set up alerts for error rates and performance issues
3. Use the `verify-feature-status.js` script to check feature status

### Rolling Back a Feature

1. Disable the feature using `deploy:disable-feature`
2. Verify the feature is disabled using `ci:verify-features`
3. Fix the issue and deploy through the normal CI/CD pipeline

## Conclusion

The feature isolation architecture provides a robust system for managing features independently. It ensures that if one feature fails, it doesn't affect the rest of the application. This improves reliability, simplifies troubleshooting, and enables faster development cycles.

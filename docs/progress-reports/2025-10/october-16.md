## Part 1: Progressive Profile Onboarding (Complete)

### What Was Built
Implemented a complete progressive onboarding system that allows users to complete their nonprofit profile in any order, with real-time progress tracking.

### Features Delivered
1. **Database Schema** (4 new models + enhanced Organization)
   - `OnboardingProgress` - Section-by-section completion tracking
   - `Program` - Organization programs/services
   - `TeamMember` - Staff, volunteers, board members
   - `FundingHistory` - Past grants and funding sources
   - Enhanced `Organization` with 20+ new profile fields

2. **Backend APIs** (6 RESTful endpoints)
   - `GET/PUT /api/onboarding/progress` - Overall progress
   - `GET/PUT /api/onboarding/sections/basics` - Organization basics
   - `GET/POST/PUT/DELETE /api/onboarding/sections/programs` - Programs
   - `GET/POST/PUT/DELETE /api/onboarding/sections/team` - Team management
   - `GET/PUT /api/onboarding/sections/story` - Impact narrative
   - `GET/POST/PUT/DELETE /api/onboarding/sections/funding` - Funding history

3. **Frontend Components**
   - **Dashboard Widget** (`CompleteYourProfileWidget.tsx`)
     - Shows completion percentage (0-100%)
     - Lists up to 4 incomplete sections
     - Auto-hides at 100% completion
   - **Profile Pages**
     - `/profile` - Overview with categorized sections

4. **Smart Features**
   - Intelligent scoring algorithm per section
   - Complete sections in ANY order
   - Real-time progress updates

   - Weighted scoring based on field importance

2. **Helper Functions**
   - `calculateSectionCompleteness()` - Get all section scores

3. **Section Metadata**
   - Icon names (for Heroicons)
   - Estimated minutes to complete
   - Required vs optional fields
   - Direct links to profile pages

2. **Gamification**
   - Badges for completing sections
   - Leaderboard for fastest completions
   - Rewards at milestones (25%, 50%, 75%, 100%)

3. **AI Assistance**
   - Auto-suggest content for story fields
   - Generate mission statements
   - Recommend programs based on focus areas

4. **Analytics**

## Architecture Decisions

### 1. Flexible Order
Users can complete sections in any order (not linear flow). This reduces friction and allows users to skip sections they need time to gather information for.

### 2. Granular Scoring
Each section scored independently with transparent point values. Users know exactly what impacts their completion percentage.

### 3. Progressive Enhancement
Widget remains visible until 100% complete, providing constant reminder and motivation. Not dismissible to prevent abandonment.

### 4. Auto-Save Draft
"Save for Later" button allows partial progress without committing to completion. Reduces anxiety about incomplete forms.

### 5. Mobile-First
All UIs tested for mobile responsiveness. Nonprofit leaders often work on phones during off-hours.

# Nonprofit AI Assistant Development Progress Report
**Date: October 18, 2025**

## Summary
Today's development session encountered significant architectural challenges that resulted in system instability. After multiple attempts to implement a feature-modular architecture, we've decided to apply the nuclear option tomorrow morning and rebuild with a more methodical approach.

## Challenges Encountered
- **Server Stability Issues**: Multiple internal server errors when implementing the feature-modular architecture
- **Import/Export Problems**: Barrel file exports causing circular dependencies and compilation errors
- **Development Environment Instability**: Persistent port conflicts and server crashes

## Decision: Nuclear Option
We will implement the nuclear option tomorrow morning, which entails:
1. Creating a clean branch from main
2. Rebuilding the architecture from first principles
3. Following a strict test-driven development approach

## Rational Development Process Going Forward

### 1. Architecture-First Approach
- Begin with clear architecture diagrams and documentation
- Establish strict module boundaries before implementation
- Create interface contracts between modules

### 2. Incremental Implementation
- Implement one feature module at a time
- Complete unit tests before moving to the next module
- Maintain working application state at all times

### 3. Testing Protocol
- Write tests before implementation (TDD)
- Implement CI checks that prevent merging untested code
- Establish coverage thresholds for critical paths

### 4. Development Workflow
- Morning standup to align on daily goals
- Feature branch for each module implementation
- Code review before any merges to development branch
- End-of-day verification of application stability

## Next Steps
1. **8:00 AM**: Team meeting to align on nuclear option approach
2. **9:00 AM**: Begin clean implementation of core architecture
3. **12:00 PM**: First integration checkpoint
4. **5:00 PM**: End-of-day review and stability verification

This reset will ensure we build on solid foundations and avoid the architectural debt that led to today's challenges.

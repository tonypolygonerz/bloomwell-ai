## üìã Pre-Test Code Analysis

### ‚úÖ Code Implementation Review

#### 1. **PricingToggle Component** (`/src/components/PricingToggle.tsx`)

**Key Findings:**

- ‚úÖ Uses React `useState` for toggle state
- ‚úÖ Dispatches `pricingToggle` custom event on toggle
- ‚úÖ "Save 16%" badge appears when `isAnnual === true`
- ‚úÖ Proper ARIA labels for accessibility
- ‚úÖ Smooth CSS transitions implemented

**Event Communication:**

```javascript
window.dispatchEvent(
  new CustomEvent('pricingToggle', {
    detail: { isAnnual: newValue },
  })
);
```

#### 2. **PricingCard Component** (`/src/components/PricingCard.tsx`)

**Key Findings:**

- ‚úÖ Listens for `pricingToggle` event via `useEffect`
- ‚úÖ Reads Stripe Price IDs from environment variables
- ‚úÖ Console logs for debugging (lines 36-37)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **PRICING MISMATCH DETECTED:**
  - Code shows: `$24.99/month`, `$20.99/month annual`
  - Should be: `$29.99/month`, `$209/year ($17.42/month)`

**Current Pricing Constants:**

```javascript
const monthlyPrice = 24.99; // ‚ùå Should be 29.99
const annualPrice = 20.99; // ‚ùå Should be 17.42
const annualTotal = 251.88; // ‚ùå Should be 209.00
```

**Console Logging:**

```javascript
console.log('PricingCard - Monthly Price ID:', monthlyPriceId);
console.log('PricingCard - Annual Price ID:', annualPriceId);
```

#### 3. **Expected Stripe Price IDs** (from `.env.local`)

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PRICE_MONTHLY=price_1SAas1GpZiQKTBAtcgtB71u4
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PRICE_ANNUAL=price_1SAatSGpZiQKTBAtmOVcBQZG
```

### Issue #2: Pricing Values Don't Match Business Requirements

**Severity:** HIGH (Revenue Impact)  
**Description:**
Current code displays incorrect pricing:

- Shows: $24.99/month, $251.88/year
- Should be: $29.99/month, $209/year

**Impact:**

- $5/month revenue loss per subscriber
- $42.88/year overcharge on annual plan
- Business logic mismatch

**Files to Fix:**

- `/src/components/PricingCard.tsx` (lines 27-29)

**Recommended Fix:**

```javascript
const monthlyPrice = 29.99; // Changed from 24.99
const annualPrice = 17.42; // Changed from 20.99
const annualTotal = 209.0; // Changed from 251.88
```

**New Savings Calculation:**

```
Monthly: $29.99 √ó 12 = $359.88/year
Annual: $209.00/year
Savings: $150.88
Percentage: 42% (not 16%)
```

**Badge Should Say:** "Save 42%" (not "Save 16%")

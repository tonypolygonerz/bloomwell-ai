All automated checks pass. Manual testing required for:
1. UI/UX verification
2. Browser compatibility
3. File upload functionality
4. Data persistence across sessions
5. Mobile responsiveness

**Recommended Test Order:**
1. Team page (simplest)
2. Budget page (multi-select validation)
3. Goals page (similar to budget)
4. Documents page (file upload - most complex)
5. Dashboard integration (overall flow)
6. Data persistence (logout/login cycle)

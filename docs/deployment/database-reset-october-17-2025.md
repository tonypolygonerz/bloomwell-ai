# Database Reset & First-Time Flow Testing - October 17, 2025

## 🔍 Investigation Summary

### What We Found
The form at `/profile/basics` was showing **saved data**, not ProPublica auto-filled data. This is **CORRECT BEHAVIOR** for a returning user in "edit mode".

**Database Query Results:**
```
Email:        test@bloomwell.ai
Org ID:       test-org-1760660957380
Name:         Test Nonprofit Organization
Mission:      To test the progressive onboarding feature
State:        California
Focus Areas:  Community Development, Education
Created:      1760660957389 (recent timestamp)
```

### Two User Flows Explained

#### Flow 1: First-Time User (Fresh Start)
```
Status:   No organization in database
Behavior: Form shows EMPTY fields with gray placeholders
Purpose:  User fills out form from scratch
ProPublica: Only auto-fills name, EIN, state, type (NOT mission/focus)
```

#### Flow 2: Returning User (Edit Mode)
```
Status:   Organization already exists in database
Behavior: Form shows SAVED data pre-filled
Purpose:  User can edit/update existing information
ProPublica: Not relevant - user already has data
```

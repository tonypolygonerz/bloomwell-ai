## Data Mapping

### CSV to Database Schema
California grant fields were mapped to Bloomwell AI's unified grant schema:

| CA Grants Field | Database Field | Notes |
|----------------|----------------|-------|
| `grant_title` | `title` | Primary grant name |
| `grant_url` | `opportunityId` | Unique identifier extracted from URL |
| `agency` / `department` | `agencyCode` | State agency information |
| `scrape_timestamp` | `postingDate` | When grant was discovered |
| `deadline` | `closeDate` | Application deadline |
| `purpose` + `details` | `description` | Combined comprehensive description |
| `eligible_applicants` | `eligibilityCriteria` | Who can apply |
| `grant_type` | `category` | "California State Grant" |
| `disbursement_method` | `fundingInstrument` | How funds are distributed |

### Unique Opportunity ID Format
- **Pattern:** `CA-{url-slug}` or `CA-{title-slug}-{uuid}`
- **Example:** `CA-wildfire-prevention-grant-program`
- **Purpose:** Ensures no conflicts with federal grants (which use federal opportunity IDs)

- **Dependencies:** `csv-parser`, `@prisma/client`
- **Features:**
  - Automatic deduplication across files
  - URL-based unique ID generation

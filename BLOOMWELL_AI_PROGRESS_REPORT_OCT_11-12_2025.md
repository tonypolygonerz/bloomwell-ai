## Chat Page Integration

### Problem Investigation

**Issue:** Chat page not using AppLayout component  
**Root Cause:** Existing chat implementation used standalone layout

**Investigation Process:**
1. Located current chat page at `/chat`
2. Identified standalone chat interface without sidebar
3. Found different styling and layout architecture
4. Determined need for complete page replacement

### Solution Implementation

**New Chat Page Structure:**
- Wrapped entire chat interface in `AppLayout`
- Added `initialCollapsed={true}` prop to start with sidebar collapsed
- Optimized layout for maximum chat area width
- Maintained existing chat functionality while adding navigation

**Enhanced AppLayout Features:**
- Added `initialCollapsed` prop to override localStorage
- Smart state management respects page-specific preferences
- Chat page always starts collapsed for optimal space usage
- Other pages continue using saved localStorage preference

**Files Modified:**
- `src/app/chat/page.tsx` - Complete integration with AppLayout
- `src/components/layout/AppLayout.tsx` - Added initialCollapsed prop support

## üîß TECHNICAL DETAILS

### Cleanup Query:
```sql
DELETE FROM grants 
WHERE closeDate IS NOT NULL 
AND closeDate < CURRENT_DATE;
```

### Execution Time:
~2 seconds for 79,462 deletions

## üöÄ AUTOMATIC CLEANUP

### Built-in Sync Logic:
The grants sync system now automatically cleans up expired grants on every sync:

**Step 1:** Download latest grants from grants.gov  
**Step 2:** Parse XML and filter nonprofit-eligible grants  
**Step 3:** **Delete expired grants** (closeDate < today - 1 day)  
**Step 4:** Upsert new/updated grants  
**Step 5:** Update sync statistics  

### Cleanup Function:
Located in: `src/lib/grants-sync.ts`

```typescript
export async function cleanupExpiredGrants(): Promise<number> {
  const oneDayAgo = new Date();
  oneDayAgo.setDate(oneDayAgo.getDate() - 1);

  const result = await prisma.grant.deleteMany({
    where: {
      AND: [
        { closeDate: { not: null } },
        { closeDate: { lt: oneDayAgo } },
      ],
    },
  });

  return result.count;
}
```

## How It Works

### Main Chat Page (`/chat`)

1. User visits `/chat` with no active conversation
2. Prompt suggestions appear in empty state
3. User clicks a prompt button
4. System creates new conversation with prompt as title
5. Sends message automatically using hybrid chat system
6. Prompt suggestions disappear once messages exist

### Chat Thread Page (`/chat/[conversationId]`)

1. User opens existing thread with no messages yet
2. Prompt suggestions appear in empty state
3. User clicks a prompt button
4. Sends message to existing thread
5. Prompt suggestions disappear once messages exist

## Design Decisions

### Why These 9 Prompts?

Selected based on nonprofit user needs:
- **Grant discovery** is top priority (4 prompts)
- **Compliance** is critical for small nonprofits (2 prompts)
- **Strategy & board** help with organizational development (2 prompts)
- **Fundraising** addresses revenue challenges (1 prompt)

### Why Auto-Send Instead of Pre-Fill?

Original chat page had "quick actions" that pre-filled input. New prompt suggestions **auto-send** for better UX:
- ✅ Faster interaction (1 click vs 2 clicks)
- ✅ Clearer intent (button means "ask this")
- ✅ Better empty state design (centered, prominent)
- ✅ Mobile-friendly (no keyboard needed)

### Why Only on Empty State?

- ✅ Reduces UI clutter during active conversation
- ✅ Focuses user attention on the conversation once started
- ✅ Provides helpful starting point without being intrusive
- ✅ Matches common chat UX patterns (ChatGPT, Claude, etc.)

## Code Quality

### TypeScript Safety
```typescript
interface ChatPromptSuggestionsProps {
  onSelectPrompt: (prompt: string) => void;
  className?: string;
}
```

### Reusability
Component works in both chat contexts with no changes needed:
```tsx
<ChatPromptSuggestions 
  onSelectPrompt={handlePromptSelect}
  className="max-w-4xl w-full"
/>
```

### Accessibility
- Semantic `<button>` elements
- Keyboard navigable (Tab + Enter)
- Screen reader friendly text
- Focus states preserved

---

## Browser Compatibility

Tested CSS features:
- ✅ Flexbox (all modern browsers)
- ✅ CSS transitions (all modern browsers)
- ✅ Hover states (desktop + touch)
- ✅ Active states (all devices)
- ✅ Tailwind opacity (all modern browsers)

---

## Performance Impact

- **Bundle size**: ~2KB (minimal)
- **Render cost**: Negligible (9 buttons)
- **Dependencies**: Zero new packages
- **Load time**: No impact (inline component)

## Future Enhancements (Not Implemented Yet)

Potential improvements for future versions:

1. **Dynamic Prompts**: Personalize based on organization type
2. **Prompt Analytics**: Track which prompts are most popular
3. **Seasonal Prompts**: Change suggestions based on grant cycles
4. **User-Specific**: Remember which prompts user has already tried
5. **Admin Configuration**: Let admins customize prompt list
6. **A/B Testing**: Test different prompt wordings

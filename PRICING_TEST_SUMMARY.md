- Server connectivity verification
- Environment variable checks
- Pricing logic validation

- 12 detailed test cases with checkboxes
- Step-by-step instructions
- Expected vs. actual result templates
- Screenshot placeholders
- Sign-off section

### 3. ‚úÖ **Environment Verification** (`ENVIRONMENT_VERIFICATION_REPORT.md`)

- Complete development environment audit

   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PRICE_ANNUAL` ‚úÖ (`price_1SAatSGpZiQKTBAtmOVcBQZG`)

### ‚ùå Issues Found (NON-BLOCKING):

**PRICING MISMATCH - Revenue Impact**

| Item          | Current Code | Should Be    | Difference       |
| ------------- | ------------ | ------------ | ---------------- |
| Monthly Price | $24.99/month | $29.99/month | -$5.00           |
| Annual Price  | $251.88/year | $209.00/year | +$42.88          |
| Savings Badge | Save 16%     | Save 42%     | Wrong percentage |

**Impact:**

- ‚ùå $5/month revenue loss per customer
- ‚ùå $42.88/year overcharge on annual plans
- ‚ùå Inaccurate discount messaging (16% vs 42%)

**Financial Impact Example:**

- 100 monthly subscribers: **-$500/month** = **-$6,000/year** lost revenue
- 100 annual subscribers: **+$4,288/year** overcharge (customer dissatisfaction risk)

**Quick Checklist:**

- [ ] Test 1: Initial page load
- [ ] Test 2: Verify console logs show correct price IDs

### Step 3: Document Your Findings

Create `PRICING_TOGGLE_TEST_REPORT.md` with:

- Screenshots of the pricing page
- Console log outputs
- Test results (PASS/FAIL for each)
- Any bugs or issues you discover
- Final verdict (WORKING / NEEDS FIX)

## üîß Recommended Fixes

### Priority 1: Fix Pricing Values (URGENT)

**File:** `/src/components/PricingCard.tsx`  
**Lines:** 27-29

**Current Code:**

```javascript
const monthlyPrice = 24.99;
const annualPrice = 20.99;
const annualTotal = 251.88;
```

**Fixed Code:**

```javascript
const monthlyPrice = 29.99; // Corrected to match business requirements
const annualPrice = 17.42; // $209 √∑ 12 months
const annualTotal = 209.0; // Annual plan total
```

### Priority 2: Fix Savings Badge

**File:** `/src/components/PricingToggle.tsx`  
**Line:** 55

**Current Code:**

```javascript
Save 16%
```

**Fixed Code:**

```javascript
Save 42%
```

**New Math:**

```
Monthly: $29.99 √ó 12 = $359.88/year
Annual: $209.00/year
Savings: $359.88 - $209.00 = $150.88
Percentage: ($150.88 √∑ $359.88) √ó 100 = 41.9% ‚âà 42%
```

### Priority 3: Verify Stripe Price IDs

After fixing the pricing display, verify the Stripe price IDs in your Stripe Dashboard match the new pricing:

- `price_1SAas1GpZiQKTBAtcgtB71u4` ‚Üí Should be $29.99/month
- `price_1SAatSGpZiQKTBAtmOVcBQZG` ‚Üí Should be $209/year

‚ö†Ô∏è **CRITICAL:** If Stripe price IDs have wrong amounts, customers will be charged incorrectly!

---

## üì∏ Expected Console Output

When you open http://localhost:3000/pricing, you should see:

```
PricingCard - Monthly Price ID: price_1SAas1GpZiQKTBAtcgtB71u4
PricingCard - Annual Price ID: price_1SAatSGpZiQKTBAtmOVcBQZG
```

If you see `undefined`, the environment variables aren't loading correctly.
